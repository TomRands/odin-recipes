        <h2>Delicious bread</h2>

        <p>A dough's first rising can be done in the fridge overnight. This slows down the time it takes to rise to double 
            its size, giving it a deeper flavour. It's also a great timesaver, as you can start it the night before, then 
            finish it off the next day.</p>

        <p>To make this in a breadmaker, add all the ingredients to your breadmaker and follow the manufacturerâ€™s 
            instructions.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>500g strong white flour, plus extra for dusting</li>
            <li>2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>7g sachet fast-action yeast</li>
            <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>300ml water</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Mix 500g strong white flour, 2 tsp salt and a 7g sachet of fast-action yeast in a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Make a well in the centre, then add 3 tbsp olive oil and 300ml water, and mix well. If the dough seems 
                a little stiff, add another 1-2 tbsp water and mix well.</li>
            <li>Tip onto a lightly floured work surface and knead for around 10 mins.</li>
            <li>Once the dough is satin-smooth, place it in a lightly oiled bowl and cover with cling film. Leave to rise 
                for 1 hour until doubled in size or place in the fridge overnight.</li>
            <li>Line a baking tray with baking parchment. Knock back the dough (punch the air out and pull the dough in on 
                itself) then gently mould the dough into a ball.</li>
            <li>Place it on the baking parchment to prove for a further hour until doubled in size.</li>
            <li>Heat oven to 220C/fan 200C/gas 7.</li>
            <li>Dust the loaf with some extra flour and cut a cross about 6cm long into the top of the loaf with a 
                sharp knife.</li>
            <li>Bake for 25-30 mins until golden brown and the loaf sounds hollow when tapped underneath. Cool on a wire 
                rack.</li>
        </ol>
