        <p>You can use the microwave to reheat lasagna if you're in a pinch or short on time, but be aware that it will 
            change the texture of the noodles. The best way to reheat lasagna is in the oven. Simply cover the leftovers 
            with foil and bake at 350 degrees F for about half an hour, or until it's heated through and the sauce is 
            bubbly.</p>
        
        <p>If you're planning to freeze lasagna, it's best to cook it in a foil baking dish. Allow the casserole to cool, 
            then cover the whole thing in at least one layer of storage wrap. Wrap it again in aluminum foil to prevent 
            freezer burn. Freeze for up to three months.</p>

            <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>¾ pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
            <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned. Stir in 
                crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 
                teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring 
                occasionally.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 
                minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, 
                remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles 
                lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella 
                cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. 
                Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, 
                either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes. Rest 
                lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
