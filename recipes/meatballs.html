        <p>
            These are “meatier” meatballs than classic recipes because there are no breadcrumbs or panade. 
            Instead, we’re swapping those with chopped onions, almond flour, and other ingredients listed below. 
            And with how good they are, you won’t even notice that they’re naturally gluten-free and low-carb. That’s 
            just a bonus.

            Is it possible to make meatballs without breadcrumbs? It sure is! Classic meatball recipes add breadcrumbs 
            and milk to create a panade (which is sorta like a soft wet paste). But because I’m gluten-free I add a mix 
            of almond flour, diced onion, grated parmesan, and chopped parsley. The onion adds moisture and the other
             ingredients prevent the meatballs from becoming too dense. I actually think my meatballs are more flavorful!

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ pound ground meat (beef, pork, or a combination of both)</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>⅓ cup finely diced onion</li>
            <li>¼ cup almond flour</li>
            <li>¼ cup finely grated fresh parmesan</li>
            <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>¼ cup finely chopped fresh parsley</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Mix the ingredients.</strong> Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C) and line a rimmed baking sheet
                 with parchment paper. In a medium bowl, combine the ground meat, egg, onion, almond flour, parmesan, 
                 parsley, garlic, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. Using your hands, mix the ingredients together 
                 until well combined (but don't over mix).</li>
            <li><strong>Scoop and roll.</strong> Measure out 1 ½ tablespoons of the mixture (or use a medium cookie scoop) 
                and roll the mixture between your hands, forming about 30 meatballs.</li>
            <li><strong>Bake until browned.</strong> Place the meatballs on the prepared baking sheet and bake for 20 to 23 minutes, until 
                lightly browned on the outside and just cooked through. If you'd like them more browned on the outside, turn
                 on the top broiler in the last 2 to 3 minutes of baking.</li>
            <li><strong>Serving ideas.</strong> You can serve the meatballs with your favorite sauce, like marinara. Just 
                heat the sauce in a pan on the stove and toss the meatballs in the sauce. Garnish with freshly chopped parsley.</li>
        </ol>
